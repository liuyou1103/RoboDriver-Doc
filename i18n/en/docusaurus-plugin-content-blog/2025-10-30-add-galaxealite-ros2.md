RoboDriver has a new ROS2 integration! The **GALAXEALITE dual-arm robot** adapter repo is now live, supporting dual 6-DOF + gripper control, with four RealSense camera streams and LeRobot-style interfaces.

The GALAXEALITE adapter includes end-to-end setup, config changes, and capture/control validation so you can deploy directly:

Highlights:
- Dual-arm coordinated motion and single-arm independent operation
- Synchronized multi-camera capture, aligned with the extended LeRobot dataset format
- ROS2 node configuration examples and comms debugging tools
